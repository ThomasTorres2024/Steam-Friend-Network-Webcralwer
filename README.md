I worked on this a bit in 2024 about a year ago haven't really touched it since. I am hoping to use this for more stuff going forward and add a clean CLI and more features and potentially some model training. 

For now, just basic visualization and recursive crawling is support. Storage is unoptimal and puts everything in raw csv files.
